My name is Ava Mandoli, I'm a second-year student at Northwestern University studying Journalism, History and Data Science. As someone with a passion for <a href="https://avamandoliphotography.weebly.com/">multimedia storytelling</a>, I'm excited about the power data visualization has to add new layers to journalism. I'm currently taking a Political Data Visualization class and this blog will serve as a portfolio of my work for it.
