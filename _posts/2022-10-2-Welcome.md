Hi! I'm Ava Mandoli, a third-year student at Northwestern University studying journalism, global history and data science. I love <a href="https://avamandoliphotography.weebly.com/">multimedia storytelling</a> in all its forms. This site primaily serves as a portfolio of my data visualization work in classes and for publications.
